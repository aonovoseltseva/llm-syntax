You are a linguist working within the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) framework. Your task is to annotate Russian sentences in 4 structured steps. Please follow this process:

Step 1: Annotate Morphological Features
Assign NUM, CASE, GEND, etc., to all relevant words (especially NPs and adjectives).

Step 2: Mark Syntactic Dependencies
Mark agreement between elements (e.g., adjectives agreeing with nouns) as CONCORD.

Step 3: Identify Grammatical Functions
Assign SUBJ, OBJ, etc., as appropriate, based on syntax and semantics.

Step 4: Build Unified Representation
Write an f-structure including:
- PRED with valence
- SUBJ and OBJ slots filled with syntactic (s) representations and morphological info"""

"""Here is the glossary to stay aligned with the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) Theory:
GRAMMATICAL FEATURES
NUM — Number: SG (singular), PL (plural)
CASE — Case: NOM (nominative), ACC (accusative), DAT (dative), GEN (genitive), INS (instrumental), LOC (locative), etc.  \n\
GEND — Gender: MASC (masculine), FEM (feminine), NEUT (neuter)
PERS — Person: 1 (first), 2 (second), 3 (third)
TENSE — Tense: PAST, PRES, FUT
ASPECT — Aspect: PERF (perfective), IMPERF (imperfective)
VOICE — Voice: ACTIVE, PASSIVE
MOOD — Mood: IND (indicative), IMP (imperative), SUBJ (subjunctive)
CONCORD — Agreement features, usually between determiners, adjectives, and nouns (NUM, CASE, GEND)
INDEX — Feature bundle used to track identity and agreement between elements (e.g., between subject and verb)

SUBJ — Subject (core argument)
OBJ — Object (core argument)
IOBJ — Indirect object
OBL — Oblique (non-core argument, typically marked with preposition or case)
COMP — Closed complement (clausal complement with subject)
XCOMP — Open complement (clausal complement without subject, subject is controlled)
ADJUNCT — Modifier (optional, peripheral element)
SPEC — Specifier (e.g., demonstratives or determiners like 'этот', 'тот')
ADJ — Adjective or modifier inside a noun phrase
STRUCTURE MAPPINGS
C-structure — Constituent structure (phrase structure tree: S → NP + VP, etc.)
F-structure — Functional structure: abstract mapping of functions and features (e.g., SUBJ, OBJ, TENSE)
PRED — Predicate representation: 'читать<SUBJ,OBJ>'

Use this glossary to ensure consistency and theoretical accuracy when annotating or revising sentence structures in LFG."""

"""Guidelines for generating high-quality constituent and functional structures according to Lexical-Functional Grammar:
Constituent Structure (c-structure):
Each wordform must be preceded by a preterminal node   indicating its grammatical class (e.g., N, V, D, A).
The number of  opening and closing brackets  must be equal — ensure balanced structure.
All words from the input sentence must appear exactly once  in the c-structure, in the correct order. No duplications.  
Follow standard phrase structure conventions (e.g., S → NP VP, NP → D A N, etc.).  
Functional Structure (f-structure):   
Ensure that the output satisfies the three well-formedness conditions as defined by Kaplan & Bresnan:  
1.  Coherence  — All grammatical functions in the f-structure must be licensed by the predicate's subcategorization frame. No extra functions.  
2.  Completeness  — All required grammatical functions from the predicate's argument structure must be present in f-structure. No omissions.  
3.  Consistency (Unification)  — Attribute values must not conflict. Each attribute (e.g., NUM, CASE) must have a unique, non-contradictory value.  
                                                              
Example (for sentence: 'те хорошие дети пришли'):

те (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
хорошие (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
дети (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
пришли (f SUBJ INDEX NUM) = PL
f[PRED 'пришли<SUBJ>';
SUBJ s[PRED 'дети', SPEC 'те', ADJ {[PRED 'хорошие']}, CONCORD [NUM PL], INDEX [NUM PL]]]
These constraints are essential for syntactic and semantic correctness. Use them to verify and revise any proposed annotation of the sentence."""
