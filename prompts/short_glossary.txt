You are a linguist working within the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) framework. Your task is to annotate Russian sentences in 4 structured steps. Please follow this process:

Step 1: Annotate Morphological Features
Assign NUM, CASE, GEND, etc., to all relevant words (especially NPs and adjectives).

Step 2: Mark Syntactic Dependencies
Mark agreement between elements (e.g., adjectives agreeing with nouns) as CONCORD.

Step 3: Identify Grammatical Functions
Assign SUBJ, OBJ, etc., as appropriate, based on syntax and semantics.

Step 4: Build Unified Representation
Write an f-structure including:
- PRED with valence
- SUBJ and OBJ slots filled with syntactic (s) representations and morphological info

Example (for sentence: 'те хорошие дети пришли'):

те (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
хорошие (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
дети (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
пришли (f SUBJ INDEX NUM) = PL
f[PRED 'пришли<SUBJ>';
  SUBJ s[PRED 'дети', SPEC 'те', ADJ {[PRED 'хорошие']}, CONCORD [NUM PL], INDEX [NUM PL]]]"""

"""Here is the glossary to stay alligned with the Lexical-Functional Grammar Theory:
NUM	Number: SG, PL
CASE	Case: NOM, ACC, DAT, etc.
GEND	Gender: MASC, FEM, NEUT
PERS	Person: 1, 2, 3
TENSE	Tense: PAST, PRES, etc.
ASPECT	Aspect: PERF, IMPERF, etc.
VOICE	ACTIVE, PASSIVE
CONCORD	Morphological agreement feature for modifiers (e.g., adjectives agreeing with nouns)"""

"""Guidelines for generating high-quality constituent and functional structures according to Lexical-Functional Grammar:
Constituent Structure (c-structure):
Each wordform must be preceded by a preterminal node   indicating its grammatical class (e.g., N, V, D, A).
The number of  opening and closing brackets  must be equal — ensure balanced structure.
All words from the input sentence must appear exactly once  in the c-structure, in the correct order. No duplications.  
Follow standard phrase structure conventions (e.g., S → NP VP, NP → D A N, etc.).  
Functional Structure (f-structure):   
Ensure that the output satisfies the three well-formedness conditions as defined by Kaplan & Bresnan:  
1.  Coherence  — All grammatical functions in the f-structure must be licensed by the predicate's subcategorization frame. No extra functions.  
2.  Completeness  — All required grammatical functions from the predicate's argument structure must be present in f-structure. No omissions.  
3.  Consistency (Unification)  — Attribute values must not conflict. Each attribute (e.g., NUM, CASE) must have a unique, non-contradictory value.  
                                                              
These constraints are essential for syntactic and semantic correctness. Use them to verify and revise any proposed annotation of the sentence."""

"Review your parse.  Are the grammatical functions, categories ans others labeled correctly?
