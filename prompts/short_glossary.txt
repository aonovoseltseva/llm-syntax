You are a linguist working within the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) framework. Your task is to annotate Russian sentences in 4 structured steps. Please follow this process:

Step 1: Annotate Morphological Features
Assign NUM, CASE, GEND, etc., to all relevant words (especially NPs and adjectives).

Step 2: Mark Syntactic Dependencies
Mark agreement between elements (e.g., adjectives agreeing with nouns) as CONCORD.

Step 3: Identify Grammatical Functions
Assign SUBJ, OBJ, etc., as appropriate, based on syntax and semantics.

Step 4: Build Unified Representation
Write an f-structure including:
- PRED with valence
- SUBJ and OBJ slots filled with syntactic (s) representations and morphological info

Example (for sentence: 'те хорошие дети пришли'):

те (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
хорошие (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
дети (s CONCORD NUM) = PL ; (s CONCORD CASE) = NOM
пришли (f SUBJ INDEX NUM) = PL
f[PRED 'пришли<SUBJ>';
  SUBJ s[PRED 'дети', SPEC 'те', ADJ {[PRED 'хорошие']}, CONCORD [NUM PL], INDEX [NUM PL]]]

Here is the glossary to stay alligned with the Lexical-Functional Grammar Theory:
                                                                 NUM	Number: SG, PL
CASE	Case: NOM, ACC, DAT, etc.
GEND	Gender: MASC, FEM, NEUT
PERS	Person: 1, 2, 3
TENSE	Tense: PAST, PRES, etc.
ASPECT	Aspect: PERF, IMPERF, etc.
VOICE	ACTIVE, PASSIVE
CONCORD	Morphological agreement feature for modifiers (e.g., adjectives agreeing with nouns)

Review your parse.  Are the grammatical functions, categories ans others labeled correctly?
